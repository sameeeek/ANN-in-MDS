The objective of the work is to implement Artificial Neural Network in Molecular Dynamics Simulation.

The codes are based on the paper: I. E. Lagaris, A. Likas and D. I. Fotiadis, "Artificial neural networks for solving ordinary and partial differential equations," in IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks, vol. 9, no. 5, pp. 987-1000, Sept. 1998, doi: 10.1109/72.712178.
